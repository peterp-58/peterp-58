Welcome to CIND 820 capstone project. This project is create a machine learning model that help predict bankrupcy. 
This model, based on working knowledge and financial expertise, will use financial ratios to determine if companies are bracing for bankrupcy. 
This will help stakeholders take actions before the company files for actual bankrupcy.
This process is cumulative in with respect to the coding, in datasetprep.ipyn. 
THe project is currently broken down to 7 subsections. 

1. Uploading and setting up the Polish Dataset
2. Variable Additions
3. Initial Descriptive Analysis
4. Approach
5. Preparing to model
6. Performance Metrics
7. Spliting Datasets into respective Years



As of July 2nd, an inital run of the models were performed with the features selected based on "why do companies go bankrupt". THe first run did not yield postive results, which 
leads me to move on to next phase, which is to split the datasets into the years. There are 5 years and i will split into 5 datasets. 

Based on inital review of the results. The confusion matrix shows that the models have missed a good chunk of the bankrupt companies. Logistic regression did not pick up any. 

The pdf, initial code provides a details to each of the steps above, except for #7, which will be the next phase to work on
